My work for  Kaggle's Regression with a Flood Prediction Dataset, Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 5

## Notebooks
`data_loading_shallow_learning.ipynb`: This notebook contains all of the EDA, preprocessing, and testing of Linear Regression and XGBoost algorithms. 
`nn.ipynb`: Neural network development, testing, and inference. 
`kan.ipynb`: A rough and experimental attempt at applying a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network to the regression problem. 


## Todo: 
* fill out model_comparison to neatly display results of each final model
